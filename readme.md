### MAEP Backend System
Our backend system was build using Laravel. Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects.
You need to config the .env file that contains the environment variables of the configurations of the system (Databases, email, queue configuration)

ItÂ´s important to know the installation process of a Laravel app.

### Deployment

Es necesario que el backend cuente con todos los permisos en la carpeta storage y en la carpeta bootstrap para ello ejecutamos:

`chmod -R 777 ./storage ./bootstrap`

### Python Libraries
