It can generate magical CRUD prototypes rapidly with full testing scripts prepared for you, requiring very little editing. Following SOLID principals it can construct a basic set of components pending on a table name provided in the CLI. The CRUD can be used with singular table entities think: 'books' or 'authors' but, you can also build CRUDs for combined entities that is a parent, and child like structure: 'books_authors'. This will generate a 'books_authors' table and place all components of the authors (controller, repository, model etc) into a Books namespace, which means you can then generate 'books_publishers' and have all the components be added as siblings to the authors. Now let's say you went ahead with using the Laracogs starter kit, then you can autobuild your CRUDs with them bootstrapped, which means they're already wrapped up as view extensions of the dashboard content which means you're even closer to being done your application.
